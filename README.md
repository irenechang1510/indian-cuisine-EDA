# Indian cuisine EDA 

A project from Kaggle, exploring the relationships between different factors in Indian dishes. The goal is to categorize the cooking time of Indian dishes using the ingredients as the main indicators. A potential application is that for restaurants or mobile ordering services, we can give a more accurate estimated time until the dish is done for customers.

My first analysis of this dataset was in 2019, when I started my first few data science projects, using R. Two years later, 2021, I decided to revisit my project and do the analysis again in Python, applying the knowledge and skills I have gained in the past two years. 

In 2019, I didn't have the right intuition about data analysis, which makes my analysis diverge from what should be my delivery goal. I have since learned the importance of revolving our analysis around an ultimate question we're trying to answer, which should be the utmost important step all great data science practitioners always mention. I couldn't make sense of it back then, but after a lot of purusing of others' books and tutorials, the intuition started to develop...

After a month of revising and working on my the models, I have been able to put together a complete A-Z classification project that I'm proud of, and I'm satisfied with the complexity of the exploration that I went to in order to do and learn from this project. The analysis notebook can be found [here](https://github.com/irenechang1510/indian-cuisine-EDA/blob/main/analysis.ipynb), as well as the evaluation notebook [here](https://github.com/irenechang1510/indian-cuisine-EDA/blob/main/evaluate.ipynb) where I summarize the performance of all models. Here are some of my takeaways, published on TowardsDataScience [here](https://towardsdatascience.com/the-struggles-and-the-tips-what-i-learn-from-doing-my-own-classification-project-dc1e70937b09?source=collection_tagged---------0----------------------------)

Besides, I started exploring the PySpark library for processing data, including tokenizing text data, discretizing continuous feature, etc
